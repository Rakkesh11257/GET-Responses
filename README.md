**JSON Response Retriever**

**Description:**
This Python script automates the retrieval of JSON responses from a list of URLs provided in an Excel file. It sends HTTP GET requests to each URL, retrieves the JSON response, and saves it as a separate JSON file. If a response cannot be retrieved for a URL, it logs the URL as having no data and saves it to a separate sheet in the Excel file.

**Features:**
- Sends HTTP GET requests to URLs with basic authentication.
- Retrieves JSON responses and saves them as separate JSON files.
- Logs URLs with no data and saves them to a separate sheet in the Excel file.
- Provides error handling for failed requests and responses.

**Usage:**
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Install the required Python packages: `requests`, `pandas`, and `openpyxl`.
3. Prepare an Excel file containing a list of URLs in column A.
4. Update the script with the path to the Excel file, authentication credentials, and output directory for JSON files.
5. Run the script. JSON responses will be saved as separate files in the specified output directory, and URLs without data will be logged in a separate sheet in the Excel file.



**Notes:**
- Ensure the Excel file contains URLs in column A and is accessible by the script.
- Replace `'username'` and `'password'` with actual credentials for authentication.
- Adjust paths, filenames, and authentication details as needed to match your environment.
