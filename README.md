# GET-Responses
This Python script automates the retrieval of JSON responses from a list of URLs provided in an Excel file. It sends HTTP GET requests to each URL, retrieves the JSON response, and saves it as a separate JSON file. If a response cannot be retrieved for a URL, it logs the URL as having no data and saves it to a separate sheet in the Excel file.
